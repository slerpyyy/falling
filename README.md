# The Endless Fall
The source code for my 256b entry at Revision 2019. This is my very first time working with MS-Dos and low level assembly, so I made sure to comment the code well enough, that I can still understand what it does if I read it again 2 weeks after the party.

## How to compile it
```
C:\> NASM.EXE -o FALLING.COM FALLING.ASM
```

## How to run it
```
C:\> FALLING.COM
```
